All my little plans and schemes,
lost like some forgotten dreams,
seems like all I really was doing,
was waiting for you.
%
When you're chewing on life's gristle--don't grumble!
Give a whistle, and this'll help things turn out for the best...
%
The only girl I ever loved, was born with roses in her eyes,
but then they buried her alive, one evening, 1945.
%
You might not believe it,
You might not believe it,
but you've got a lot in common,
You really do.
You both love me and I love both of you.
%
Hold the line, love isn't always on time.
%
Let me know what's in your heart,
That's a good place to start,
All I need a small sign,
And I'll give my heart to you.
%
Although our love is still special,
Let's take a chance and fly away, somewhere, alone...
%
Don't go jumping waterfalls, please keep to the lake;
People who jump waterfalls, can sometimes make mistakes.
%
When I get older, losing my hair,
Many years from now...
Will you still be sending me valentines,
Birthday greetings, bottles of wine?
%
Will you still need me,
Will you still feed me,
When I'm Sixty-Four?
%
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
%
I get by with a little help from my friends.
%
What do I do when my love is away? (Does it worry you to be alone?)
How do I feel at the end of the day? (Are you sad, because you're on your own?)
No, I get by with a little help from my friends.
%
(Do you believe in love at first sight?)
Yes, I'm certain it happens all the time.
(What do you see when you turn out the light?)
I can't tell you--but I know it's mine.
%
Life is very short, and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend,
I have always thought... that it's a crime, and so I ask you once again...
%
Oh! Darling-- please believe me,
I'll never do you any harm.
Believe me when I tell you,
I'll never do you any harm...
%
He's a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his Nowhere Plans, for no-body.
%
Set beside a mountain stream,
See her waters rise,
Listen to the pretty sound of music,
As she flies.
%
You're a diamond in the rough, a brilliant ball of clay,
You can be a work of art, if you just go all the way...
%
You are a natural, why is that so hard to see?
Maybe it's just because you keep looking at me,
The journey's a lonely one; so much more than we know,
But sometimes you've got to go, and be your own hero.
%
Now what it would it take to break? I believe you can bend.
Not only do you have to fight--but you have to go to win!
%
Although the future is a bit frightening,
It's the book of your life that you're writing.
%
By dawn's first light I'll come back to your room again,
With my carnation hidden by the packages,
I'm carrying, something...
I'm carrying... something for you.
%
I want to break free from your lies, you're so
Self satisfied... I don't need you!
%
I've fallen in love for the first time,
This time I know it's for real,
I've fallen in love, God knows!
God knows I've fallen in love!
%
It's strange but it's true,
I can't get over the way you love me like you do,
But I have to be sure, when I walk out of that door,
That I want to break free.
%
But life still goes on,
I can't get used to living without, living without you,
By my side,
I don't want to live alone, Hey,
God knows I've got to make it on my own...
%
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl,
But she doesn't have a lot to say,
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl but she changes from day to day,
I wanna tell her that I love her a lot,
But I've got a belly full of wine,
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl, and some day I'm gonna make her mine.
%
I've got my mind set on you, I've got my mind set on you,
And this time I know it's for real.
%
Once there was a way,
To get back home,
Sleepy darling, do not cry,
and I will sing you a lullaby.
%
All we are saying, is give peace a chance.
%
Welcome to your life,
There's no turning back now,
Even while we're sleeping,
We will find you acting on your best behaviour,
Turn your back on mother nature,
Everybody wants to rule the world.
%
Well it's all right, riding around on the breeze.
Well it's all right, if you live the life you please.
Well it's all right, doing the best you can.
Well it's all right, as long as you lend a hand.
%
Well it's all right, even if they say you're wrong
Well it's all right, sometimes you gotta be strong
Well it's all right, as long as you got somewhere to lay
Well it's all right, everyday is judgment day
%
Well it's all right, even when push comes to shove
Well it's all right, if you got someone to love
Well it's all right, everything'll work out fine
Well it's all right, we're going to the end of the line
%
Well it's all right, even if you're old and grey
Well it's all right, you still got something to say
Well it's all right, remember to live and let live
Well it's all right, the best you can do is forgive
%
Well it's all right, riding around in the breeze
Well it's all right, if you live the life you please
Well it's all right, even if the sun don't shine
Well it's all right, we're going to the end of the line

There is a flower within my heart,
Daisy! Daisy!
Planted that way by a glancing dart,
Planted by Daisy Bell!
%
Whether she loves me or loves me not,
Sometimes it's hard to tell,
But I'm willing to share the lot,
Of beautiful Daisy Bell!
%
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do,
I'm half-crazy all for the love of you,
It won't be a stylish marriage, I can't afford a carriage,
But you'd look sweet, upon the seat, of a bicycle built for two.
%
We will go tandem as man and wife,
Daisy! Daisy!
Peddling away down the road of life,
I and my Daisy Bell!
%
When the road's dark, we can both despise policeman and lamps as well,
There are bright lights in the dazing eyes of Daisy Bell!
%
I will stand by you in weal or woe,
Daisy, Daisy!
You'll be the belle which I'll ring, you know,
Sweet little Daisy Bell!
You'll the lead in each trip we take, and then if I don't do well...
I will permit you to use the brake, my beautiful Daisy Bell!
%
If hadn't been for Cotton Eye Joe,
I'd been married long time ago...
%
Take a jump across the water,
I can see America,
See the girls in California,
Hoping it's going to come true,
But there's not a lot I can do...
%
I hear the drums echoing tonight...
%
She hears only whispers of a quiet conversation...
%
I know that I must do what's right--
sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti.
%
What do you say, will the human race be run in a day?
%
Will someone save this planet we're playing on? Is it the only one?
%
Come on people, let the fun begin,
We've got a future and it is rushing in.
Call all the minstrels from the ancient shrine,
Let them know it's right this time.
%
Back then long time ago when grass was green,
Woke up in a daze,
Arrived like strangers in the night,
Long time ago when was fab.
%
I light a candle to our love,
In love all problems disappear,
But all in all, we soon discover,
that one and one is all we long to hear.
%
I'm gonna try for an Uptown Girl.
%
Low key, no pressure; just hang with me and my weather!
%
Rose-Colored Boy; Here you're making all that noise about the world you want to see,
I'm so annoyed because I just killed off what was left of the optimist in me.
%
And hearts are breaking,
Wars are raging on,
And I have taken my glasses off,
You've got me nervous, right at the end of my rope,
A half-empty girl, don't make me laugh, I'll choke.
%
Just let me cry a little bit longer,
I ain't gonna smile if I don't want to.
%
Hey, man, we all can't be like you,
I wish we were all rose-colored too,
My rose-colored boy.
%
This is the world we live in,
And these are the hands we're given,
Use them and let's start trying,
To make it a place worth living.
%
I can see the fires still alight, they're burning into the night.
%
Superman, where are you now?
When everything's gone wrong somehow,
The men of steel, the men of power,
Are losing control by the hour.
%
All that I want is to wake up fine,
Tell me that I'm alright,
and I ain't gonna die.
%
Hard times: Gonna make you wonder why you even try
%
Hard times: Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry.
%
Tell my friends I'm coming down,
We'll kick it when I hit the ground.
%
I can't think of getting old, it only makes me want to die.
%
The dream is good if you don't wear it out.
%
I'm just a little bit caught in the middle,
I try to keep going but it's not that simple.
%
Nostalgia's cool, but it won't help me now.
%
Another brick-red room, another black-top town
Another misspelled band burning their own houses down
Another pine-box tune to fill the cemetery day
Another star, a touch of orange over purgatory gray
%
More misguided ghosts, more transparent hands
To drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our riot dance
%
You see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
%
In any case please let me know if there's more I can give you
If nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful
%
You don't have to tell me
If you ever think of me
I know you say you're busy
Wildly, in the fog of your memory
You don't have to tell me, I can still believe.
%
Of all the weapons you fight with
Your silence is the most violent.
%
Be sure to put your faith in something more
I'm just a girl and you're not as alone as you feel.
%
Oh, no, I know where this goes (eh, eh, eh, eh)
Think it's safe to say your savior doesn't look a thing like me!
%
Ain't it fun, living in the real world?
%
I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top.
%
Been through the wringer a couple times
I came out callous and cruel.
%
The three of us were initiates
We had to learn how to deal
And when we spotted a second chance
We had to learn how to steal
%
We're driving fast in my car
We've got our riot gear on but we just want to have fun
No we're not looking for violence, no oh oh oh
Tonight we want to have fun
%
Feels like I'm waking from the dead, and everyone's been waiting on me.
%
At least now I'll never have to wonder what it's like to sleep a year away.
%
I never thought that what would take me out was hiding down below.
%
If there's a future, we want it now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
%
Let them have their time
Sit back and let them shine
Let them rise and rise
Cause one day they're going to fall
%
Let them soak in the sun
Sit back and let them have their fun
Let them spill their guts
Cause one day they're going to slip on them
%
I could be angry, but you're not worth a fight,
and besides, I'm moving on.
%
Let them do their thing
Cause that will never be you and me
We've got our own style
We've got our way of living life.
%
I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone...
%
Here comes the rain again,
Falling from the stars.
%
Summer has come and passed,
The innocent can never last.
%
What ever happened to the life that we once knew,
It always made me feel so free.
%
You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches far ahead.
%
And in my hour of darkness, Mother Mary comes to me,
Singing words of wisdom,
"Let it be."
%
The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
I've seen that road before go on,
It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.
%
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona for some California grass,
Get back! Get back! Get back to where you once belonged!
%
Listen to the wind blow, watch the sun rise
Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies
%
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
%
Listen to the wind blow, down comes the night
Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence, damn the dark, damn the light
%
These mist-covered mountain tops are a home now for me,
But my home is the lowlands, and always will be.
%
Some day you'll return to your valleys and your farms,
And you'll no longer burn to be brothers in arms.
%
Through these fields of destruction,
Baptisms of fire,
I've witnessed your suffering as the battle raged high,
And though they did hurt me so bad in the fear and alarm,
You did not desert me, my brothers in arms.
%
Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
%
But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms
